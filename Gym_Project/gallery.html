                    Aerobic exercise (also known as cardio) is physical exercise of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process. 
                    Aerobic means relating to involving, or requiring free oxygen and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. 
                    Generally, light-to-moderate intensity activities that are sufficiently supported by aerobic metabolism can be performed for extended periods of time.
                    What is generally called aerobic exercise might be better termed solely aerobic because it is designed to be low-intensity enough so that all carbohydrates are aerobically turned into energy.

                    <h4 style="font-size: 1.3em">Body Building</h4>
                    Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature for aesthetic purposes. 
                    An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. 
                    In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, and conditioning. 
                    Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of nonessential body fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular dehydration and carbohydrate loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity, as well as tanning to accentuate the contrast of the skin under the spotlights. 
                    Bodybuilders may use anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to build muscles.

                    <h4 style="font-size: 1.3em">Yoga</h4>
                    Yoga is a systematic practice of physical exercise, breath control, relaxation, diet control, and positive thinking and meditation aimed at developing harmony in the body, mind, and environment. 
                    The practice entails low-impact physical activity, postures (called asanas), breathing techniques(pranayama), relaxation, and meditation. 
                    Most people are familiar with the physical poses or yoga positions but don't know that yoga involves so much more.
