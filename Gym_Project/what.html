                    Step aerobics offers a more intense workout. 
                    It provides extra boost by incorporating the action of stepping on to the platform to intensify the workout. 
                    It is a form of low impact and does not stress the joints as much as running and jogging. 
                    The action of stepping does not shock the joints.<br/>
                    During the Step Aerobic exercise, you position a footstep in the frontage, which you step one foot up, 
                    down and up on the other leg, replicating the course of action for quite a few minutes. 
                    The process is intended to tone the lower body.

                    <strong style="font-size: 1.3em">Low impact aerobics</strong><br/>
                    Low-impact aerobics are those movements involving large muscle groups used in continuous rhythmic activity in which 
                    at least one foot contacts the floor at all times. It has developed to decrease the lower leg overuse injuries 
                    associated with high-impact classes.
                    This type of exercise is ideal for seniors, pregnant women and overweight people. It is beneficial for those who have 
                    not exercised for some time. With low impact aerobics, more fit people may have difficulty achieving required 
                    intensity, therefore they are told to use larger movements.
                    It means when you begin walking, you may walk with slow rate and slowly increase your step length and move your arms 
                    as you walk to get to the same level.

                    Aerobic kickboxing is also called as cardio boxing or boxing aerobics. It is a tremendous way of achieving a beautiful body. 
                    This type of exercise leads to quick weight loss. You feel more energetic and enthusiastic at the end of the session.<br/>
                    Aerobic kickboxing is used for toning your body and tightening your muscles and makes you look younger. 
                    It acts as a great stress reliever and enhances your flexibility level and blood circulation.

                    The Hip-Hop aerobics is a dance aerobics routine, which mixes together funk with contemporary dance. 
                    Hip-Hop aerobics incorporates the usage of high energy dance, while focusing on the entire form of the body.
                    If you are a beginner, your instructor will direct and teach you the grooves, rhythm, rhyme and moves required to 
                    benefit from dance aerobics. If you want to lose weight fast, this is the most effective exercise.
                    You might like it so much you might take dance classes for hip hop.

                    The best ever playtime fun of everyone's childhood is rope skipping. Rope skipping is the most inexpensive type of 
                    aerobic exercise that needs a jumping rope. Skipping is performed by continuous jumping and skipping between the 
                    rope's circular motions that can be increased to high intensity to get effective results in weight loss. 
                    Skipping tones calves, thighs, buttocks, tummy and waist which means an overall workout for achieving a perfect 
                    shape with rapid fat burning.
                    However one of the best things to be made aware about skipping is that it is one of the best forms of exercises 
                    which can be performed not only by the children but also by the adult men and women.

                    Spot jogging is another type of aerobic exercise that is a very easy, comfortable and inexpensive form of workout 
                    that needs a spacious room or a wise place. You have to stay at a spot and start jogging by moving your legs in a 
                    cycling motion like you do while jogging in a park. You can enjoy your room temperature and there will be no dust 
                    and harmful sunrays. Spot jogging is performed for consecutive 5-10 minutes with 60 seconds resting time. 
                    It improves heart rate to regulate fat and calories burning capacity.

                    One of the super effective type of aerobic exercise that keeps your entire body in shape and enhances your cognitive 
                    functions is swimming. A swimming suit with a pair of swimming glasses is all what you need to perform swimming. 
                    However, there are many people who love to swim without all these accessories to enjoy the water activity. 
                    Swimming is a type of aerobic exercise that tones your shoulder and upper arm muscles as well as keeps your tummy flat 
                    and toned. Your legs get super strength by performing this activity and it is also a best option for summer exercises.
                    It can offer you the health benefits of an aerobic exercise without impacting your joints; thereby it can be practiced both by elderly people as well as by young generation.

                    One of the most enjoyable forms of aerobic exercises that can be performed with no risk factors and is highly 
                    beneficial as well as entertaining is aerobic dancing. These types of aerobic exercises are usually performed at 
                    aerobic dance classes or general aerobic classes and some gyms. Aerobic dances include ballet, disco, jazz and samba 
                    that tone up your entire body with a enjoyable music that not only improves your physical fitness but also improves 
                    your mental health by reducing depression and anxiety.

                    Hiking is a wise way of exercising similar to climbing stairs. The difference between hiking and stair climbing is 
                    when you climb stairs you get layers which can be risky for joint health. But hiking is not that tough for joints 
                    and is an adventurous type of aerobic exercise that tones thighs, legs, buttocks, waist and abdomen muscles.
                    These above mentioned aerobic exercise types are the most effective workout forms that help to achieve 
                    cardiovascular fitness as well as entire physical fitness. Cardio exercises also improve mental health by reducing 
                    stress and depression promoting healthy lifestyle. However, safety precautions and measures must be followed and 
                    taken care of while performing these aerobic exercises.

                    <strong style="font-size: 1.3em">Tempo Contrast</strong><br/>
                    This method recruits more muscle fibers due to the different types of rep contractions. 
                    Additionally, alternating between slow reps and fast reps allows for the momentary "capturing" of waste products inside the muscles, 
                    which leads to the release of growth factors that stimulate protein synthesis and muscle growth.
                    The accumulation of metabolites, as well as trapped blood inside the muscle, 
                    leads to an excruciating pump. This method works especially well for biceps, 
                    quads (leg extensions, leg press), hamstrings (leg curls), and chest (cable cross-overs, pec deck, flyes), 
                    as well as pressing exercises like bench press and squats.

                    <strong style="font-size: 1.3em">Regressive Range of Motion</strong><br/>
                    This method is especially effective with compound movements, particularly those with a longer range of motion. 
                    It works great with the bench press, squat, and even deadlift. 
                    It can also be used successfully with exercises like curls, 
                    triceps pushdowns, leg curls, leg extensions, hack squats, and leg presses. 
                    It doesn't work as well with overhead work or pulling exercises.
                    You start the exercise by doing a full range of motion. 
                    You do reps until you're close to hitting failure, then cut the range of motion in half and do more partial reps. 
                    When you feel that you're about to hit failure in that partial range, 
                    you again cut the range of motion in half until you finally hit total failure. 
                    Depending on the exercise.

                    <strong style="font-size: 1.3em">Intra-Set Load Contrast</strong><br/>
                    This method takes advantage of the "potentiation effect" of heavy lifting. By doing a heavy lift first, 
                    you excite the nervous system and neuromuscular junctions and turn on more muscle fibers. 
                    If you immediately switch to hypertrophy work using the same movement pattern, 
                    you'll keep more fibers active and stimulate more growth.
                    <br/>
                    Use two different loads for each set. 
                    Load the bar with 75% of your maximum. Then, slap on a pair of collars. 
                    You'll then add an additional 10-15% weight on the other sides of the collars. 
                    This will make it easier to quickly remove the additional weight before doing the drop set.

                    <strong style="font-size: 1.3em">Partial and Isolation Superset</strong><br/>
                    This is a superset, so two exercises are done back-to-back with minimal rest. 
                    The first exercise is a major lift done with a partial range of motion and the second is an isolation exercise.
                    How you do your partial reps is important. Keep the target muscle under tension long enough, 
                    so perform the partial reps in a "no-acceleration" style.
                    <br/>
                    Try to maintain the same fairly slow speed during the whole range of motion, focusing on keeping the tension on the target muscle.
                    It should take you about the same time to complete one partial rep as it would a full rep. 
                    Do 8-10 reps on both the partials and the isolation exercise.

                    <strong style="font-size: 1.3em">Mechanical Drop Sets</strong><br/>
                    This is based on the same principle as drop sets: 
                    once you hit failure on an exercise, you find a way to continue doing work. 
                    With drop sets you reduce the weight so you can get more reps in. 
                    With mechanical drop sets you keep the SAME weight on the bar or machine but you change the exercise slightly so that you gain a mechanical 
                    advantage and can continue while working the same muscles.
                    A mechanical drop set can include two or three variations. The order, whether you're using two or three variations, 
                    is always to start with the weakest variation and work toward the strongest. That way, when you hit failure on the first movement, 
                    you can still get some reps on the next one.

                    the lower spine. You have to do a lot of fast moving postures with periods of relaxation where you will be taught to 
                    pay attention to internal sensations and the flow of creative energy so that you can tap into your kundalini-shakti.

                    Popularised by celebrities worldwide, Ashtanga or the “eight limb path” is very physically demanding so you should 
                    not do this if you are a beginner or not in great physical shape. It involves doing multiple surynamaskars followed 
                    by standing and floor postures. There are six series of postures that have to be repeated in every class. 
                    This kind of yoga is also called Power Yoga and in this style you start with the primary series and then graduate to 
                    the next level when you have mastered it. It takes years of practice to master this form.

                    This is an offshoot of Ashtanga and also involves a number of athletic yoga postures and each movement is coordinated 
                    with one’s breath. This is also a very physically demanding practice. The pace is quick and you will not have to hold 
                    any one pose for too long. The key is to flow from one pose to the next so your heart rate gets pumping. 
                    Both Ashtanga and Vinyasa are great if your aim is to tone your body. It also works your core and upper body and gives 
                    you a cardio workout. This practice does not have a set structure and often depends on the teacher who might include 
                    some meditation and chanting.

                    Created by yoga guru Bikram Choudhury, the key feature of this practice is to do a set of poses in a room heated to 
                    41 degrees centigrade and 40 percent humidity. In a 90-minute sequence there are 26 basic postures that are done 
                    twice and two breathing exercises. The heat makes you sweat excessively thereby getting your body rid of toxins 
                    while the postures work every part of your body and bring oxygenated blood to all your internal organs. 
                    Drink plenty of fluids to rehydrate.

                    Yoga is not just a workout but a deeply spiritual experience and if you want to know this practice in its totality then 
                    you should try the Jivamukti style. Founded in 1984 by Sharon Ganon and David Life, Jivamukti incorporates Vinyasa style 
                    postures and sequences accompanied with chanting, meditation, deep relaxation and pranayama. There is also some emphasis 
                    on philosophy, poetry and music. Jivamukti centres also offer courses in Hindu scriptures, Sanskrit and kirtans. 
                    Jivamukti proponents are also expected to be vegetarian.

                    If you are not into too much hectic activity, then Yin yoga is just the practice for you. This slow-paced style 
                    lets you hold poses for a longer time—from 45 seconds to two minutes. There are also a lot of seated postures and a 
                    ocus on spirituality, inner peace and relaxation. By holding poses for a longer time, you stretch your connective 
                    tissue and make it more elastic. You also improve blood circulation and the qi energy in your body. Props help you 
                    relax into the postures instead of keeping your muscles flexed and taut. This style is often practiced in a heated 
                    room to help your muscles become more elastic. You must not try this if you are super flexible (as you can get 
                    injuries if you over-stretch) or have any connective tissue disease.

                    If you are in stressful job, this is just the yoga practice for you. As the name suggests, restorative yoga postures 
                    are meant to relax and rejuvenate. Many of the classic yoga poses have been modified so that they are easier to do and 
                    are more relaxing. This practice helps you tap your parasympathetic nervous system so that you can truly relax your 
                    mind and body deeply. Like Iyengar yoga this style too takes the help of props like blankets, bolsters and yoga 
                    blocks to help you perfect each yoga pose without straining yourself too much.

                    In this version of Hatha yoga, Anusara yoga has postures that are used in a Vinyasa practice and here too there 
                    is a lot of focus on alignment. However, in Anusara the mind-body-heart connection is key and you will be 
                    encouraged to uplift yourself, find inner peace and the “light within yourself.” This style uses props to help you 
                    reach the perfect pose.
